    <p>This recipe is from my dad and they are a favorite among friends and family. The secret ingredient is the coconut! <em>Be warned</em>, these will fly off of the plate!</p> 
    <p>Cookies appear to have their origins in 7th century AD Persia, shortly after the use of sugar became relatively common in the region. They spread to Europe through the Muslim conquest of Spain. By the 14th century, they were common in all levels of society throughout Europe, from royal cuisine to street vendors.</p>
